    "## Scenario\n",
    "The city of Chicago is deploying a domain awareness system.  The system is going to deploy at least 100 cameras, similar to that of New York City. Policatl leaders have decided that cameras should only be deployed in historcal crime hotspots. And cameras should only be placed in spots where it's very likely they will capture crimes. \n",
    "You work for a contractor that is tasked with running the analysis to determine the best coordinates of each camera.\n",

    "### Steps \n",
    "+ Data Loading data from chicago open crime portal ( use the API to subset to crime types and time periods to make the data set a reasonable size\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Select only crime types you feel would likely be observable by camera and approprate use , subset the data accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Build and analyize at least two types of cluster models over a series of parameters, to ensure optimum number of clusters are reached and good clustering is achieved, with minium 100 cluster centers using Silhouette scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ When optimium clustering is found, get GPS Coordinates of each cluster allong with the aggregate counts of crimes in that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables \n",
    "+ Jupyter notebook that builds two cluster models and optimized parameters\n",
    "+ Plot of Clusters Lat and Long with Cluster Centers\n",
    "+ List of the 100 Crime Cluster locations with crime counts (using only the top 100 cluster by crime count)\n",
    "+ Estimate the coverage of the perecent of crimes that the cameras will be near. \n",
    "+ Executive summary (elevator pitch) that describes how you developed that camera locations,  inclusion / exclusion critera methodoly on crimes and ethical considerations of this approach.  \n"
